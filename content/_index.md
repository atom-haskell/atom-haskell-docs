# Atom-Haskell documentation

Welcome to Atom-Haskell documentation site.

Information collected on these pages should help you get started with Haskell in Atom editor.

Click one of the links on the left to start reading.

## Chat

We have a chat room on the Matrix network <https://matrix.to/#/#atom-haskell:matrix.org?via=matrix.org>, devs can usually be found there. Bear in mind that if someone's on the channel, it doesn't necessarily mean they aren't AFK.

We also have a Gitter chat room on <https://gitter.im/atom-haskell/ide-haskell> which is bridged to Matrix.

We also have #atom-haskell IRC channel on <https://libera.chat/>, which is also bridged to Matrix.

Matrix and Gitter are preferred platforms, mostly because IRC doesn't do offline messaging at all, and sometimes we end up reacting to messages the moment user logs off, which is somewhat frustrating.
