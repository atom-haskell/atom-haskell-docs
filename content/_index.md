# Atom-Haskell documentation

Welcome to Atom-Haskell documentation site.

## Chat

We have a chat room on the Matrix network <https://matrix.to/#/#atom-haskell:matrix.org?via=matrix.org>, devs can usually be found there. Bear in mind that if someone's on the channel, it doesn't necessarily mean they aren't AFK.

We also have a Gitter chat room on <https://gitter.im/atom-haskell/ide-haskell> which is bridged to Matrix.

We also have #atom-haskell IRC channels on <https://freenode.net/> and <https://libera.chat/>, with the former is bridged to Matrix, but the latter isn't (as of the time of writing).

Matrix and Gitter are preferred platforms, mostly because IRC doesn't do offline messaging at all, and sometimes we end up reacting to messages the moment user logs off, which is somewhat frustrating.
